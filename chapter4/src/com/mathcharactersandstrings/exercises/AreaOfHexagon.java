 * 4.4 (Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following
 * formula (s is the length of a side): Enter point 1 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 39.55
 * âˆ’116.25 Enter point 2 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 41.5 87.37 The distance between the
 * two points is 10691.79183231593 km Area = 6 * s2 4 * tan(p) 6 Write a program that prompts the
 * user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area. Here is a sample run:Enter the side:
 * 5.5 The area of the hexagon is 78.59
